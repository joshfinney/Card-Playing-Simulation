# Multi-threaded Card Playing Simulation
The game is played with a deck of cards, each numbered from 1 to 8, and is played by multiple players. The game consists of rounds, during which each player draws and plays a card from their hand or deck. The player with the highest card value wins the round and scores a point. The game ends when one player reaches a predetermined number of points.

## 💻 Requirements
- Java 11 or higher
- An IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA (optional)

## 🏗️ Configuration
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: ```git clone https://github.com/joshfinney/Card-Playing-Simulation```  .
2. Open the project in your IDE and make sure that it builds successfully.
3. To start a new game, run the Main class. You will be prompted to enter the number of players and the location of the card pack file.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## 🎨 Customisation
#### Changing the number of points needed to win
Modify the gameEnded variable in the playTurn method of the Player class.

Here is an example of how you could change the game to end when a player reaches 10 points instead of 5:
```javascript
if (score >= 10) {
    gameEnded = true;
}
```

#### Customizing the card pack
Create a text file with a list of integers, one per line, ranging from 1 to 8. Save the file to the src directory, and specify its location when prompted at the start of the game. The game will validate the pack to ensure it contains the correct number of cards.

Here is an example of a card pack file with 8 cards:
```
2
3
6
1
2
5
3
1
```
